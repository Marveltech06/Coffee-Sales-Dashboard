# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
This project analyzes coffee sales data using Excel to create an interactive dashboard. It highlights sales trends, country performance, customer contributions, and product preferences, enabling data-driven insights and business decisions for improved growth and strategy.
## Project Summary
![](Coffee.png)
This project focuses on analyzing sales data for a coffee retail business to uncover insights that can guide decision-making. The dataset includes information on order dates, product categories (coffee type, roast type, package size), customer purchases, country of sale, and loyalty card usage.

The dashboard was developed to provide both high-level KPIs and granular analysis of sales patterns. With interactive slicers, stakeholders can filter the data by time periods, roast type, package size, and customer loyalty status. This interactivity makes the dashboard flexible for different reporting needs, whether monthly performance reviews or customer-level profitability analysis.

Through the visualizations, business leaders can track total sales performance over time, compare country-level sales contributions, identify top-performing customers, and evaluate how product characteristics (such as coffee type and roast preference) affect sales.
The project not only demonstrates data analysis and Excel visualization skills but also highlights the ability to translate raw data into actionable business insights that can support strategic decisions like market expansion, customer retention strategies, and inventory planning.
Objective: To analyze coffee sales data and create a dashboard that highlights key sales patterns.
## üóÇÔ∏è Data Description
**Raw Data**
The raw dataset contains transaction-level coffee sales records with fields such as:
- Order Date
- Customer Name
- Country
- Coffee Type (Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, Excelsa)
- Roast Type (Light, Medium, Dark)
- Package Size (0.2kg, 0.5kg, 1.0kg, 2.5kg)
- Sales Amount (USD)
- Loyalty Card (Yes/No)
The raw file included duplicates, inconsistent date formats, and missing values that required preprocessing.
**Clean Data**
The cleaned dataset was prepared for analysis by:
- Removing duplicates and correcting data inconsistencies.
- Standardizing date formats for time-series analysis.
- Ensuring uniform category names (e.g., Roast Type, Coffee Type).
- Handling missing values and validating sales amounts.
The clean dataset provided a reliable foundation for building the interactive dashboard and extracting meaningful business insights.
